### About me:
I'm a 25 year-old girl from Minsk. I graduated from Minsk State Linguistic University and currently I'm working as a Translator of articles about manufacturing companies. I like my job, but I don't want to work as a Translator all my life, so I decided to gain new skills and change my occupation.
My goal is to learn more about Front-end Development with the help of this course and start a career of a Web Developer.

### Code example:
**Task:** write a program that takes a list of numbers as input. The program must for each element of this list print the sum of its two neighbors.
```
a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
if len(a) == 1:
  print(*a)
else:  
  f = 0
  b = []
  while f < (len(a) - 1):
    b.append(a[f - 1] + a[f + 1])
    f += 1
  if f == (len(a) - 1):
    b.append(a[f - 1] + a[0])
    print(*b)
```
